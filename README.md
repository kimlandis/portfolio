# Technical writing portfolio for Kim Landis

I have over 15 years of experience in software documentation for developers, professionals, and end users. Here are some examples of my work.

As a vendor at Microsoft, I have provided initial scaffolding of content as well as updates and bug fixes in [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/?WT.mc_id=learnaka) for a total of over 2,800 contributions in two years.

- [My GitHub account at Microsoft](https://github.com/kimlandisoohio/?azure-portal=true). Here you can see all of my commits in the Learn BizApps and Learn Dynamics repositories during my time as a contractor at Microsoft.
- [A sample of published Learn content](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/retail-intelligent-order-management/). This is an example of my scaffolding work for Microsoft. I use a .bat file to roughly convert Word content to markdown, and another .bat file to create the framework of folders, .yml, and .md files, and then follow Micsrosoft rules to ensure that the content shows up correctly and run Acrolinx to fix any wording issues.

At Stratifyd, I created documentation for an AI analytics platform. I created all of the documentation for the product from conception through publishing on Confluence. I had no knowledge of AI or machine learning before writing this documentation, and relied heavily upon my skills in research, interviewing SMEs, and understanding very rough communication from an international team of data scientists. Ultimately, I learned to research and write what I thought was correct, and then ask the SMEs to review and correct my drafts.

This is sample content that I created in Confluence. Since it was behind a paywall, I re-configured the content in GitHub markdown, and omitted all of the links to other documents.

- [Sample reference-type article from Stratifyd documentation](stratifyd-auto-learn.md) I used this format as a template for each type of AI model algorithm, and used reference materials to learn about each type. I used Visio to create the diagram.
- [Sample procedural-type article from Stratifyd documentation](stratifyd-model-feedback-loop.md) This article contains a number of step-by-step procedures that I verified prior to publishing, and provided screenshots to orient the user. I used SnagIt to create the screenshots.
